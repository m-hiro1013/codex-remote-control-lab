# Release QA Inventory - v0.2.0

## Release Context

- repository: `Sunwood-ai-labs/codex-remote-control-lab`
- release tag: `v0.2.0`
- compare range: `v0.1.0..release/v0.2.0`
- requested outputs: review response, PR merge, GitHub release body, docs-backed release notes, companion walkthrough article
- validation commands run: `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run docs:build`, `git diff --check`, local bridge smoke test of `/api/info`, `/api/threads`, `/api/thread`
- release URLs: pending until PR merge, tag creation, docs deployment, and GitHub release publication
- validator note: PowerShell (`pwsh` / `powershell`) is not installed on this Mac, so the skill's PowerShell QA and SVG validators could not be executed directly. SVG XML/root/viewBox checks were run with Python instead.

## Claim Matrix

| claim | code refs | validation refs | docs surfaces touched | scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default startup URLs share one bridge-managed thread | `scripts/bridge-state.js`, `scripts/start-phone.js`, `scripts/bridge-state.test.js` | `npm test`, local bridge smoke test | `docs/guide/releases/v0.2.0.md`, `docs/ja/guide/releases/v0.2.0.md`, walkthrough pages | phone bridge default URL |
| Existing headless app-server attachment is supported | `scripts/start-phone.js`, `README.md`, `docs/guide/phone-bridge.md` | `npm run check`, local `/api/threads` smoke test | README, phone bridge docs, release docs | OCdex bridge app-server connection |
| History sync warms app-server history with `thread/read` and scan-backed `thread/list` | `scripts/history-sync.js`, `scripts/start-phone.js`, `scripts/history-sync.test.js` | `npm test`, local `/api/thread` smoke test | README, phone bridge docs, release docs | history sync and selected thread polling |
| API polling avoids excessive app-server activation and request overlap | `scripts/start-phone.js`, `public/main.js` | `npm run check`, GitHub Actions `verify` | release docs and walkthrough | `/api/thread` and browser polling |
| Startup notifications handle missing LAN URLs without undefined provider links | `scripts/phone-notify.js`, `scripts/phone-notify.test.js` | `npm test` with no-LAN URL case | phone bridge docs, release docs | ntfy and Pushover notification metadata |
| Run-state UI respects reduced motion and improves contrast | `public/main.js`, `public/style.css`, `public/index.html` | `npm run check`, previous contrast smoke check, GitHub Actions `verify` | release docs and walkthrough | browser run-state banner |

## Steady-State Docs Review

| surface | status | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | pass | Added v0.2.0 release notes link; existing phone bridge and notification sections already describe core env vars and safety model |
| `README.ja.md` | pass | Added Japanese v0.2.0 release notes link; existing Japanese phone bridge docs remain aligned |
| `docs/guide/phone-bridge.md` | pass | Added missing-LAN notification behavior and repeated polling error suppression |
| `docs/ja/guide/phone-bridge.md` | pass | Japanese truth-sync for missing-LAN notification behavior and background polling errors |
| `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs` | pass | Added English/Japanese release and walkthrough links to nav/sidebar |
| `docs/index.md` / `docs/ja/index.md` | pass | Reviewed; no release-specific steady-state update required because nav/sidebar now exposes release pages |

## Notes

- blockers: none currently known
- waivers: PowerShell validator unavailable on this Mac; Python XML validation used for SVG structure checks
- follow-up docs tasks: verify live docs URLs after GitHub Pages deployment and update release body only if any route differs
