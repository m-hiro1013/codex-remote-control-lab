# Phone Bridge

The phone bridge starts a local Codex app-server, waits for `/readyz`, and then starts a small HTTP/WebSocket bridge for browser clients on the LAN.

## Start

```bash
npm ci
npm run phone
```

The command prints one URL per LAN IPv4 address:

```text
http://192.168.11.8:45214/?token=...
```

Open the exact printed URL from a phone or another browser on the same network.

## Runtime Layout

```text
phone browser
  -> token-protected bridge on 0.0.0.0:45214
  -> Codex app-server on ws://127.0.0.1:45213
```

The bridge shares a thread across multiple browser clients. Add `thread=<thread_id>` to resume a known Codex thread.

## Useful Environment Variables

```bash
PHONE_UI_PORT=45214 npm run phone
CODEX_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/some-project npm run phone
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4 npm run phone
PHONE_TOKEN=choose-your-own-token npm run phone
```
