# Codex Remote Control Lab

Codex Remote Control Lab is a local-first experiment for OpenAI Codex CLI `remote-control` and `app-server` workflows. It keeps the Codex app-server on `127.0.0.1`, then exposes only a small token-protected browser bridge to devices on the same LAN.

## ✨ What It Does

- starts a repository-local Codex CLI `0.130.0` app-server
- serves a phone-friendly browser UI with thread resume, artifact preview, approvals, model selection, and image attachments
- shares one bridge-managed Codex thread across a phone and desktop browser
- keeps `.phone-token`, `.uploads/`, `.codex-home*/`, logs, and session databases out of Git
- publishes bilingual docs through VitePress and GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/codex-remote-control-lab.git
cd codex-remote-control-lab
npm ci
npm run phone
```

The command prints a URL like this:

```text
http://192.168.11.8:45214/?token=...
```

Open that exact URL from a phone connected to the same Wi-Fi/LAN.

## 🧭 Architecture

```text
phone browser -> http://Mac-LAN-IP:45214 -> Node bridge -> ws://127.0.0.1:45213 -> Codex app-server
```

The safer boundary is intentional: Codex's app-server remains bound to localhost; only the small token-protected bridge is reachable from the LAN.

## 🧪 Verification Commands

```bash
npm run check
npm run docs:build
npm audit --omit=dev
```

Protocol-only smoke test:

```bash
npm run server:ws
npm run probe:ws
```

The local smoke test verified `initialize` and `thread/start` through the WebSocket app-server, plus `/readyz` and `/healthz` behavior.

## 📱 Phone Bridge

Useful environment variables:

```bash
PHONE_UI_PORT=45214 npm run phone
CODEX_WORKDIR=/Users/admin/Prj/some-project npm run phone
CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.4 npm run phone
PHONE_TOKEN=choose-your-own-token npm run phone
```

The current phone bridge supports:

- Codex Desktop-like browser layout with a left thread sidebar, central conversation, right artifact panel, and bottom composer
- recent thread listing and direct thread resume
- plugin, model, config/auth, and automation status panels
- approval and sandbox mode controls for the next turn
- Markdown rendering in chat and artifact previews
- Markdown image links rendered inline where possible
- browser-selected image attachments sent as Codex `localImage` inputs
- local repository image artifacts served through token-protected file routes
- collapsed status/tool logs with expandable detail rows

## 🔐 Safety Notes

- Keep the Codex app-server on `127.0.0.1`.
- Do not bind an unauthenticated Codex app-server to a LAN or public interface.
- Use SSH forwarding, a VPN, or a mesh network for access outside a trusted LAN.
- Delete `.phone-token` or set a new `PHONE_TOKEN` after demos on shared networks.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the public-safe checklist.
